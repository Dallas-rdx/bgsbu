        Skill Development &amp; Placement Centre
      </h1>
      <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
        Training and Placement are integral parts of the BGSBU educational programmes. For this purpose the University has been maintaining a full-fledged Placement Cell with a whole-time Placement Officer. The Cell organizes training activities round the year, coordinates with the corporate sector, prepares prospective students, and facilitates campus selection.
      </p>
      <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
        Realizing the role the Placement Cell has been playing in making our product employable, the University is planning to expand and convert it into the Centre for Employability Skills Development, with the long-term aim of raising it into the Skills Capital of Jammu &amp; Kashmir. To be employable, a fresh pass-out must possess the requisite knowledge in the area of his specialization, necessary skills, and aptitude (KSA). While knowledge is imparted through the formal classroom teaching-learning process, skills and aptitude are honed by professionals in skills development. The budding professionals are also helped to become clear, correct, and confident in their communication.
